# Hello, World! 👋

Welcome to **A Dev Writes**. I'm Laxman Sharma, and this is my corner of the internet dedicated to the craft of software engineering.

## Why This Blog?

In our fast-paced industry, we often copy-paste solutions without deeply understanding them. My goal here is different: **to slow down and dissect the "why" and "how" of complex systems.**

## What You Can Expect

I write about the problems I've faced in production and the patterns I've learned to solve them. Key topics include:

*   **Distributed Systems**: Microservices patterns, consistency models, and resilience.
*   **Observability**: Going beyond logs to true system visibility (check out my [OpenTelemetry series](/tags/#opentelemetry)).
*   **Engineering Culture**: Building high-performing teams and pragmatic processes.
*   **Java & Spring**: Deep dives into the ecosystem I work with daily.

## Join the Conversation

This isn't just a broadcast channel. I want to learn from you too. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laxman-sharma-328b2659), [GitHub](https://github.com/laxman-sharma), or check out my profile on [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/resume/laxman-sharma).

Detailed, technical, and practical. That's the promise.

Grab a coffee ☕ and let's build something great.
