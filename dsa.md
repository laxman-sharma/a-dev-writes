title: Data Structure & Algorithms
permalink: /dsa/
---

Welcome to the **A Dev Writes** DSA series. This collection is designed to take you from the basics to advanced algorithmic problem solving.

We've organized the course into modules. Each module starts with the fundamental theory behind the data structure, followed by a curated list of practice problems found in technical interviews.

---

## 1. Array

Arrays are the building blocks of data structures. Learn memory layout, access patterns, and in-place algorithms.

👉 **[Start Module 1: Arrays]({{ "/dsa/array/" | relative_url }})**

---

## 2. Strings

Understand immutability, the string pool, and efficient string manipulation techniques.

👉 **[Start Module 2: Strings]({{ "/dsa/strings/" | relative_url }})**

---

## 3. Linked List

Master pointer manipulation with Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists.

👉 **[Start Module 3: Linked Lists]({{ "/dsa/linked-list/" | relative_url }})**

---

## 4. Trees

Explore hierarchical structures including Binary Trees, BSTs, and traversals (BFS/DFS).

👉 **[Start Module 4: Trees]({{ "/dsa/trees/" | relative_url }})**

---

## 5. Graphs

Dive into network modeling with standard traversals, shortest path, and topological sort.

👉 **[Start Module 5: Graphs]({{ "/dsa/graphs/" | relative_url }})**
