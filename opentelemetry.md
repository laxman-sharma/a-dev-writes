# OpenTelemetry with Java

OpenTelemetry is the industry standard for cloud-native observability. In this comprehensive course, you will learn how to instrument Java microservices from scratch, moving from basic traces to advanced production patterns.

## Course Modules

### [Module 1: Foundations]({{ '/opentelemetry/module-1-foundations/' | relative_url }})
Understand the core concepts of Observability. Learn what Traces, Metrics, and Logs are, and how OpenTelemetry unifies them. Set up the Java Agent for zero-code instrumentation.

### [Module 2: Implementation]({{ '/opentelemetry/module-2-implementation/' | relative_url }})
Go beyond auto-instrumentation. Learn how to manually create spans, add custom attributes, record business metrics, and correlate logs with traces for deep debugging context.

### [Module 3: Production]({{ '/opentelemetry/module-3-production/' | relative_url }})
Prepare for scale. Learn about the OpenTelemetry Collector architecture, sampling strategies to manage cost, and performance tuning for high-throughput systems.
